<!-- In an HTML document, you typically place your <script> tags either in the <head> section or at the end of the <body> section. The choice depends on the functionality of your scripts and your optimization goals. Here's a breakdown of each approach:

  Inside <head> section:
  Placing scripts in the <head> section ensures that they are loaded and executed before the browser renders the content of the page. This can be useful for scripts that are essential for the page to function correctly, or if you want to ensure that certain scripts are available before the rest of the page loads. -->

    <!-- At the end of <body> section:
      Placing scripts at the end of the <body> section ensures that they are loaded after the HTML content has been rendered. This can lead to faster perceived page load times because the browser doesn't have to wait for scripts to load before rendering visible content. This approach is often used for non-critical scripts or scripts that manipulate the DOM after it's been fully loaded. -->

<!-- It's important to note that scripts placed at the end of the <body> section should generally not contain code that relies on the DOM elements defined above them, as those elements may not yet be available when the scripts execute. If your script needs to manipulate DOM elements, consider using techniques like event listeners or the defer attribute to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before the script executes. -->
